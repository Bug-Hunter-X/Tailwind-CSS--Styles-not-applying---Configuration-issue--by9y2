# Tailwind CSS Configuration Issue

This repository demonstrates a common problem encountered when using Tailwind CSS: styles not being applied due to incorrect configuration. The `tailwind.config.js` file contains a configuration that might omit files from the `content` array, preventing Tailwind from picking up the styles in your components.  The `App.js` file showcases a simple component demonstrating the expected behaviour after the config is corrected.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Try to start the project. Note that the styles might not apply properly.
4. Modify the `tailwind.config.js` to include the correct path.
5. The application should now successfully load with the styles applied.

## Solution

The problem is typically resolved by ensuring that the `content` array in `tailwind.config.js` correctly specifies the location of your template files. You need to adjust the paths to match the directory structure of your project.
